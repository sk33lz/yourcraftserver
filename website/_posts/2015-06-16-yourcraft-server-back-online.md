After some extended downtime due to lack of time, I was finally able to get the YourCraft Server moved back to an Ubuntu server. I've also updated it to 1.8.7 as there were some new security updates. The server should run much smoother now with less downtime as it kept crashing in Windows for some reason. With the new setup I can run multiple servers inside of Docker containers, so I will probably be spinning up some old favorites like Wrath of the Fallen and other older Minecraft Adventure maps. More details on those as they unfold.

Happy Mining and Crafting!
