I've updated the YourCraft Multiverse server to Minecraft v1.7.5 along with updated a bunch of plugins to what seem to be more stable releases. No need to downgrade your clients anymore in the launcher :) We were having a few issues with bugs in some addons that caused some grief, literally. Because of the griefing we are re-enabling the YourCraft Whitelist until we are fully confident in our grief prevention methods.
