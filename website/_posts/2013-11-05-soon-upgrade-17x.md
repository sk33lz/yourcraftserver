I have been really busy with work lately and haven't had a chance to update the server to 1.7. I will work on it this week/weekend and hopefully have everything back online then. Because there are so many changes happening in this version and the amount of additions since we started the server, we may generate a new spawn world and move the original spawn world to a warp.
