The Minecraft 1.4.7 Pre-release is out. It contains a few bug fixes. I am not going to be adding this to the server quite yet, not until Spigot is updated and all of our mods are at least. It's not required for us to update the server as 1.4.6 clients will still be able to connect to 1.4.7 servers, and visa versa.

Here are the bug fixes:

- Fixed crash related to arrows fired from dispensers
- Fixed a multiplayer crash when using fireworks without a fireworks star
- Fixed long timeout when checking SRV records

You can download the 1.4.7 Pre-release files here:

- Client: [http://assets.minecraft.net/1_4_7/minecraft.jar](http://assets.minecraft.net/1_4_7/minecraft.jar)
- Server: [http://assets.minecraft.net/1_4_7/minecraft_server.jar](http://assets.minecraft.net/1_4_7/minecraft_server.jar) (or [EXE](http://assets.minecraft.net/1_4_7/Minecraft_Server.exe))

For those not headed out for a New Years celebration this year, it's no better time to test out some Minecraft fireworks from the 1.4.6 release on YourCraft Server to ring in the New Year :) For those who are, please be safe out there!
