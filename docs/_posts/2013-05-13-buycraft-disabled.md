I have decided to disable Buycraft, as it costs more than we get donations for. We thank all the players who donated by purchasing a package while it was enabled. We will be modifying the donation system a bit because of this, as we still want players to be able to donate and purchase in-game ranks if they want to.

It probably won't be as "neat" as the Buycraft system, but we will be able to collect donations without additional fees, which means more cool stuff for less! We will also be able to accept other methods of payment including Bitcoin and Litecoin.
