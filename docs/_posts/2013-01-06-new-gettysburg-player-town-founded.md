I would like to personally congratulate as personally as I can over the Internet ginjix2 for being the first Mayor to setup a Player Town on YourCraft Server. Congratulations ginjix2 for founding New Gettysburg, our first Player Town! This is a major server achievement, and deserves a special recognition on the website. Be the first to do something cool on the server like this and you too can be Internet famous! :D

You can visit New Gettysburg by taking the NewGettysburg Warp sign at the Town Warp Boat near Spawn in the Main World. If you aren't sure what the Town Warp Boat is, just look around for an old wooden ship near spawn. You can't miss it!
