There have been some major updates recently for Minecraft and I wanted to get them pushed to the server. I just updated the server to 1.10.2, which includes both the Combat Update and the Frostburn Update are now Live on YourCraft Server. There are a ton of updates including shields, dual-weilding, new mobs, new blocks, and generally lots of awesomesauce. I'll be keeping an eye on any of the plugins that might not be working right and update them when I have time. I mainly just wanted to get the server updated to get the new content available for everyone.

Peace,
