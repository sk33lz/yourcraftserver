Well, I couldn't wait any longer for all the server addons to be released, so we have gone ahead and started a new world seed for 1.7.2 to play on. YourCraft Server is now online running Vanilla right now. You will need to get on the whitelist until we get some anti-griefing addons available for 1.7.2. Hopefully that will be in the next week or so. Until then, use the contact page to request an invite to the white list. Please include your player name.
