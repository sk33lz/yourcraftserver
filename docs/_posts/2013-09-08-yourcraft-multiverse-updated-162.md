I apologize for the extended YourCraft Server downtime, but I had a lot going on the last few months, and the server took a backseat to those things. Initially I tried to get the server updated to 1.6 and was having some issues with the network settings. I did not have that much time to figure it out at the time, so I took the server offline for a bit. I found some time today and I was able to finally get my servers updated to 1.6.2 today. I'm sure that you have updated your Minecraft clients at this point, so I hope to see at least some of the our old players back online sometime in the future.
