We have so far not recieved a 1.7 server release that is worth adding to the server yet. We had thought that it was pointless and that everyone was playing 1.7, but it appears that no servers are running 1.7 with any addons anyway. We have decided to let the server run on 1.6.4 for the time being until a full 1.7 release is available for Spigot and some addons are updated. If you have already updated to 1.7, you can easily play 1.6.4 with the new launcher by editing your profile and changing the use version option to 1.6.4. We will post here when we will be able to update to 1.7.
