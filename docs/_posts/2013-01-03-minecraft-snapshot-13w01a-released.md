The Mojang team has released the first Minecraft snapshot of 2013. It includes some pretty awesome new features that will be included in the upcoming Minecraft 1.5 Redstone Update.

**Here are some of the cool features so far:**

* Redstones circuits are more consistent and pistons should be more stable
* Added the Redstone Comparator block (this replaces the Capacitor we talked about at Minecon)
* Added the Daylight Detector block
* Added a Hopper block (still work in progress)
* Added a chest that activates redstone
* Added weighted pressure plates that detect item stacks
* Added Block of Redstone block (works as a pushable redstone torch)
* Added a new ore to the Nether
* Added a Nether Brick item for crafting Nether Brick blocks
* A whole bunch of other stuffâ€¦ Try for instance double-clicking items, or drag-placing them, in the inventory
