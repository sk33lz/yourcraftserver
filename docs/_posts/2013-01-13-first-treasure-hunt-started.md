I have launched our first Treasure Hunt on YourCraft Multiverse. Somewhere hidden in our main world, there is a secret room with a chest in it. Inside that chest is a treasure! 

**The treasure for our first Treasure Hunt includes:**

* 1x - Golden Sword with Luck 1 Enchant
* 1x - Golden Boots with Featherfalling 1 Enchant
* Some other cool swag!

**Hints:**

* The treasure is hidden above ground, not in any caves or dungeons below the surface.
* The treasure is hidden within the current viewable area of our dynamic world map.

Good luck to everyone!
