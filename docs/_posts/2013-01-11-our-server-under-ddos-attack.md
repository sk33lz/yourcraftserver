So it appears that either someone didn't like their ban, or we have been randomly or specifically targeted by a DDoS attack. A Distributed Denial of Service attack is illegal in the United States where this server is hosted, so I can assure you that if any IP that has connected to this server and was banned had anything to do with this attack, you will be hearing from the proper authorities on the matter. DDoS attacks are stupid, and will get you arrested if you get caught. Consider that a warning.
