We started adding some Adventure Maps to the YourCraft Multiverse server last week, and they have been fairly popular so far. One map in particular, [Wrath of the Fallen](http://hypixel.net/threads/wrath-of-the-fallen-minecraft-adventure-map.488/) by [Hypixel](http://hypixel.net/), has become so popular that we wanted to give it it's own server. There are currently 2 Wrath of the Fallen map instances available for 1-2 player co-op, with plans to expand that to 5 for the time being. The map is recommended for 2 players, so grab a friend and check it out.

We are currently testing out another Minecraft Adventure map by Hypixel, [Herobrine's Mansion](http://hypixel.net/threads/herobrines-mansion-adventure-map.200/), on our testing server. We plan to add another live server for this map in the near future. Keep it locked to YourCraftServer.com for more details!
