## Cloning our Website
We request that if you do fork our repository that you clear out all of our custom content from the `/website/_pages`, `/website/_posts`, and `/website/_docs` directories. We are working on a demo-site directory that will be an easy copy to build a site with just a few demo pages.

Coming soon.
